# For Ubuntu Server

$ sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
$ sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
$ sudo unlink /etc/resolv.conf

Then edit /etc/resolv.conf creating a new file and put this inside:

$ sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 127.0.0.1
search ubuntu
(set the same hostname!)

# Original resolv.conf (if needed on emergency):
nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search localdomain

# PiHole

Configure Container as HOST!
